Reverse Engineering
===================

**This repository contains some of the executables that I've cracked.**

The Crackme's
-------------

Every crackme directory contains the original ``crackme.exe`` to solve including the patches or loaders that I created. The ``README.rst`` includes the level of difficulty, the source I got the crackme from and the author's crackme instructions.

Other Stuff
-----------

Some directories contain things other than crackme's (mostly cracked trials). These should only be used for learning purposes as they are probably illegal.
